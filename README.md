# No-Call Predictor (Demo)

This project is a demonstration of a predictive model that estimates the likelihood of a test failure (no-call) in a prenatal screening context. The application is intended for exploration and conceptual development — not for clinical use.

## 🔍 Purpose

To showcase how an app might help physicians assess no-call risk based on patient characteristics.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a demo and **not suitable for clinical or diagnostic purposes**. The underlying model is not validated and should not be used in patient care.
