# No-Call Predictor (Demo)

This project is a demonstration of a predictive model that estimates the likelihood of a NIPT test failure (no-call) due to insufficient fetal DNA in the maternal sample. The application is intended for exploration and conceptual development ‚Äî not for clinical use.

## üîç Purpose

To showcase how an app might help physicians assess no-call risk based on patient characteristics.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimers

This is a demo and **not suitable for clinical or diagnostic purposes**. The underlying model is not validated and should not be used in patient care.
